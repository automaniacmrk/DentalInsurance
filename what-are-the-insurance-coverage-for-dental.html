For enrollment and benefit eligibility purposes, departments will accept certificates of same-sex marriage without discrimination based on gender. Employees married to a same-sex spouse prior to or following the US Supreme Court decisions on June 26th, 2013, or who were in a domestic partnership but married following the federal court decision, and wish to add their spouse and/or their spouse's dependent children, have the opportunity to enroll their spouse and their spouse's eligible dependent children onto their dental. If already in a same-sex marriage prior to the Court's decisions and had your spouse enrolled on your benefits, the state was obligated to report those benefits as income and withhold additional federal income taxes, social security and Medicare from your paycheck. If this applies to you, you must notify your departmental personnel office and have them assist you to stop the additional federal tax withholding. Otherwise, your tax status will remain "as is" and the additional federal income taxes, Social Security and Medicare will continue to be withheld. For further assistance, please contact the departmental personnel office.</li></ul><p>Consistent with the June 26, 2013, United States Supreme Court decisions, same-sex marriages are legally recognized in California.
