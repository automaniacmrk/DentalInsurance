Here's a quick breakdown of how these features apply to your dental care.</p><ul><li>The Deductible is what you have to forgo your insurance in order to cover the cost of your coverage.</li><li>Co-pay: A co-pay is a set dollar amount your dental insurance carrier requires you to pay for certain services and procedures. Your deductible may be reduced depending on which policy you have.</li><li>The amount of dental care that you pay after meeting your deductible is determined by co-insurance. If you have 30% coinsurance, your policy pays 30%.</li><li>Maximum annual benefit: This is the maximum amount your insurance pays out for each person on your policy during the calendar year.</li></ul><p>The type and policy you choose will determine your deductible, copay, coinsurance and maximum annual benefits. Progressive Health by eHealth offers four types of plans, with varying degrees of coverage and costs.</p><ul><li>DPPO: This allows you to visit most dentists. However, in-network dental care is more affordable. There is a copay, deductible, and annual maximum benefit.</li><li>DHMO: Only one facility or dentist must be chosen from the network. Out-of-network providers are not covered. There is no maximum or deductible, and you only pay co-pay.</li><li>Fee-for service: This means that you can see almost all dentists, but there is a charge.</li><li>Discount plans: You have no limitations on your choice of dentist. With each visit, you pay a discounted fee and pay the rest of your care out of pocket.</li></ul><p>Before you <a href="https://www.chamberplan.ca/product/group-benefits/dental-coverage">apply for dental insurance</a>, ensure that you are comfortable with the network limitations and any out-of-pocket expenses.</p><h2>The Dental Insurance You Need At The Price You Want</h2><p>Chamber of Commerce makes it easy to quickly find the right dental plan for you.
