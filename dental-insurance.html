Departments will accept same-sex marriage certificates for benefit eligibility and enrollment without regard to gender. If an employee is married to the same-sex spouse before or after the US Supreme Court decision on June 26, 2013, or if they were married in a domestic partner but divorced following that federal court ruling, the department will accept the certificate. Employees who wish to include their spouse or their dependent children into their dental benefits have the option to do so. If already in a same-sex marriage prior to the Court's decisions and had your spouse enrolled on your benefits, the state was obligated to report those benefits as income and withhold additional federal income taxes, social security and Medicare from your paycheck. You must inform your departmental personnel to have the federal tax withheld stopped. Your tax status, including the withholding of additional federal income taxes and Medicare, will not change. For further assistance, please contact the departmental personnel office.</p><ul><li>Dependent children employed by the state and eligible for state-sponsored dental plans are also eligible to enroll in their parent's state-sponsored dental plan.</li></ul><p>Dependent children employed by the state and eligible for state-sponsored dental plans are also eligible to enroll in their parent's state-sponsored dental plan.</p><h2>Delta Dental Preferred Provider Option (Ppo) - Group #9946</h2><ul><li>The state-sponsored Delta Dental Preferred Provider Option (PPO) plan provides services through its network of participating dentists and allows you to see any dentist of your choice world-wide and still be covered.</li><li>While your current dentist might be a Delta Dental PPO member, not all Delta dentists can join the PPO network. Your share of dentist fees may be significantly higher if you are not part of the PPO network. You may contact Delta Dental to ensure there's a PPO provider available in your service area.</li><li>The fee-for service agreement between Delta Dental and your PPO provider determines the cost of services. Each type of treatment is not covered by the plan. Based on what type of treatment the member receives, any balance owed will be paid by them.</li></ul><p>The amount of your monthly premium is deducted from your monthly pay warrant according to the number of enrolled dependents</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://dentistinleessummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dental-insurance-companies-300x253.png" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dental Insurance" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Finding Dental Coverage In California</h2><p>Chambers of Commerce health plans automatically provide pediatric dental care for children under 18. Many plans that are available off the Exchange also include pediatric dental insurance. Adults can get dental coverage in California by purchasing it as a supplement to their health insurance plan or on a stand-alone basis. Sometimes, stand-alone plans offer richer benefits. The exception to this rule is when dental insurance is added to an employer's health plan. Small business dental plans sometimes offer more benefits and orthodontia coverage may be less expensive to include. To find dental coverage, contact your Health Insurance Agent/Broker or your Human Resources Department, if your employer offers group health insurance.</p><p>These are the terms most commonly used to describe dental insurance. Becoming acquainted with them will help you in understanding California dental insurance policies and in choosing the one that is right for you.</p><h2>Chambers of Commerce</h2><p>Chambers of Commerce, a dental HMO provides comprehensive benefits for you and your loved ones and quick referrals to specialists. To enroll, you must be a resident of California.</p><p>You will be referred to specialist dentists if necessary when you sign up for network dentistry. The Chambers of Commerce network consists of private practice dental facilities that have been screened by Delta Dental for quality. Some areas of California have more network providers than others, so be sure there are dentists available in your area before choosing this plan.</p><p>You may change your dentist at any time by calling the Chambers of Commerce Customer Service number to request the change. Visit the Chambers of Commerce website for a list of participating dentists.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.healthmarkets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Elderly-gentleman-speaking-with-dentist-e1586379651645-1280x720.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dental Insurance" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Enrollment</h2><p>The deadline to sign up for a dental plan is 60 days after the date that you were hired or when you become eligible.</p><ul><li>If eligible, you may also enroll during the annual Open Enrollment period.</li><li>Except as noted, new employees who are represented may only select a prepaid plan after they have worked for 24 months without any permanent breaks during the 24-month qualifying period.

Here's a quick breakdown of how these features apply to your dental care.</p><ul><li>Deductible: This is the amount you're required to pay out-of-pocket before your insurance kicks in.</li><li>Co-pay: A co-pay is a set dollar amount your dental insurance carrier requires you to pay for certain services and procedures. Depending on the insurer or policy, your co-pay may count towards your deductible.</li><li>Co-insurance: This determines what percentage of your dental care you'll pay for after you meet your deductible. So, if you have 30% co-insurance, you'll pay 30% of your dental costs, while your insurance pays 70%.</li><li>Maximum annual benefit: This is the maximum amount your insurance pays out for each person on your policy during the calendar year.</li></ul><p>Your deductible, co-pay, co-insurance, and maximum annual benefit vary based on the individual policy and type of plan you select. There are four plan types offered through Progressive Health by eHealth, each with a varying degree of choice and out-of-pocket cost.</p><ul><li>DPPO: You can go to most dentists, though in-network dentists are less expensive. You have a co-pay for procedures, with a deductible and maximum annual benefit.</li><li>DHMO: You must choose one in-network dentist or facility; out-of-network dentists are not covered. There is no maximum or deductible, and you only pay co-pay.</li><li>You pay an additional fee for each service, but you can still visit most dentists.</li><li>Discount plans: You have no limitations on your choice of dentist. You pay a reduced fee for each visit and the remainder of your care is paid out-of-pocket.</li></ul><p>When choosing a dental insurance plan, make sure you're comfortable with any network limits and out-of-pocket costs associated with your plan before applying.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.deltadental.com/content/dam/ddpa/us/en/articles/why-dental-insurance-is-a-win-win-for-small-businesses-and-their-employees-/small%20business%20win.png" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dental Insurance" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Get the Dental Insurance you Need at the Price You Desire</h2><p>Progressive Health by eHealth makes it easy to quickly find the right dental plan for you.

Your share of the cost of services depends on whether you use a dentist in Delta Dental's PPO network or an out-of-network dentist.</p><p>If you choose a PPO dentist, you will usually pay less for services. PPO dentists agree to accept a reduced fee for services, and the dentist will complete and submit all claim forms for you at no charge. Preventive dentistry -- exams and cleanings -- is free of charge; basic dentistry, such as fillings and extractions, is covered at 80 percent after you meet the $50 annual deductible, and most other dental care is covered at 50 percent, up to $1,700 per year.</p><p>Delta has more than 43,700 PPO dentists in California and 234,000 nationwide. To see a list of Delta Dental PPO dentists, visit the Delta Dental website.</p><p>Although Premier dentists at Delta Dental aren't part of the PPO network, they have agreed to pay a lower fee and will submit claims forms on your behalf. Delta Dental covers 75 percent of basic dentistry costs after annual deductible if you use a Premier dentist, up to $1,500 per year. You may need to submit a claim form to Delta Dental if you visit a non-affiliated dentist. Delta cannot assure you what percentage of the charged fees may be covered.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.moneytalksnews.com/workers/images/width=1920/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/14152818/shutterstock_1892599030-scaled.jpg?s=e8dbd03e4c6f39ca3446b269b9a37e93de5853945166d503eb1744a834436280" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dental Insurance" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Uniform Dental</h2><p>Uniform Dental coverage is available only if you are enrolled in Wisconsin Public Employers Group Health Insurance Program or the State of Wisconsin.
